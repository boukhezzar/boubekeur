	abstract = {This paper intends to study and implement recent state observation techniques of the ultra-local model used in model-free control approach in two different methodologies, through an ultra-local model-based algebraic estimator and using an ultra-local model-based derivative estimator. The estimation is based on Taylorâs expansion coefficients for an arbitrary order. This research serves a discrete implementation details of the proposed approach using operational calculus and finite impulse response filters. A comparative study between algebraic and derivative estimators is presented. Different tests have been verified on a position trajectory control scheme of a DC motor that is subjected to disturbances and uncertainties. The used ultra-local model design is independent of initial conditions and stands in need only to measure the systemâs input and output values. This study shows that the proposed design reduces the nonlinearities and increases the robustness to disturbances resulting from Coulomb friction effects. Moreover, the algebraic and derivative estimation process is computed in real-time. The evidence of the recommended approaches has been examined by numerical simulation and compared with other strategies.},

	abstract = {Experiments lab occupies a very important place in the learning methodologies. In the engineering fields, the students pass a large part of their time in these labs. However, the achievement of the practical experiments requires in the most cases expensive equipment such as: measuring instruments, acquisition cards, computing stations, â¦etc. on the other hand, the considerable increase of the student number needs the duplication of experiment work stations. This contributed also to increase the experiments global cost. In this case the majority of educational institutions suffer in front of this logistical problem. Therefore, the remote labs give a practical solution to this problem. They allow sharing the same experiment lab to a larger number of students. Moreover, they give a remote access to hardware experiments without the necessity of people displacement. So, they lead to save the time and reduce inactivity days. Remote labs capitalize the large diffusion of the Internet over the world. Essentially, they exploit web-based platforms to give an interactive interface to the users. This interface interacts directly with the remote hardware.

In this work, an automatic control lab for robotics education is mounted and tested. The remote lab deals with physical experiments on undergraduate level for automatic control. The whole architecture of the remote lab is based on ISA architecture. The main objective of this work is to teach students the basic principles of modeling and control of the robot manipulators.  The platform allows the client or the student to access through his account in order to: make reservation, launch the experiment and view experiment storage results. The student manipulates the experiment via a developed graphical user interface GUI based on LabVIEW environment. This GUI has two control modes for this robot manipulator; point-to-point control and trajectory control. During the experiment, the student can visualize in real time the robot's movement via an IP camera.  Moreover, the GUI displays in real time the Cartesian coordinates of the end effector position and the joint angles corresponding to this position. the student can also enter the values of the desired points or trajectories on which he wants to control his robot. The GUI has been designed to help students to fully understand the control technique of arm robot as well as the interest of using the direct and the inverse kinematic model.},

It is installed on a server machine at Constantine 1 university, Algeria. It is compatible with LabVIEW and web browsers. The remote end-user needs only a web-browser and an installed plug-in to access to all the Remote Lab physical experiments via a GUI.

Many experimental setups are mounted. They give a practical aspect to theorical course followed by the students. The implemented control strategies are :
1. Optimal control,
2. Polynomial control,
3. State space control.

A classical PI/PID control strategy is added to serve as reference for comparison. Once logged, the user can choose an experiment and ask for a reservation time to lead the experiment. The user can then launch the experiment directly from its web-browser. At the end of the experiment, all the data generated during it are stored in the server. The data can be downloaded by the user and the instructor for analysis and evaluation. The instructor can also consult a journal including students connections history.},

The controller acts only on low wind speed area. It consists of a doubly fed induction generator controller coupled with a model predictive aeroturbine controller. Unlike the majority of existing work on DFIG, the nonlinear controller deals directly with the generator model without any simplifying assumptions. This makes it possible to remove some assumptions on the DFIG model. The nonlinear DFIG controller achieves asymptotic torque and flux tracking. For the aeroturbine part, the model predictive controller uses predictions of the output to compute the optimal control sequence. It makes a compromise between power capture optimization and loads reduction. The controllers design procedure is detailed. The global controller is tested with the parameters of a real experimental variable speed wind turbine. It is compared with PID and LQG controllers. The simulations show satisfactory results in comparison with these schemes. The proposed controller achieves better power capture optimization and load reduction. It therefore allows a good achievement of the design objectives.},

The use of a two-mass model is motivated by the need to deal with flexible modes induced by the low-speed shaft stiffness. The main objective of the proposed controllers is the wind power capture optimization while limiting transient loads on the drive-train components. This paper starts by an adaptation of some existing control strategies. However, their performance are weak, as the dynamics aspects of the wind and aeroturbine are not taken into consideration. In order to bring some improvements, nonlinear static and dynamic state feedback controllers, with a wind speed estimator, are then proposed. Concerning the wind speed estimator, the idea behind this is to exploit the WT dynamics by itself as a measurement device. All these methods have been first tested and validated using an aeroelastic WT simulator. A comparative study between the proposed controllers is performed. The results show better performance for the nonlinear dynamic controller with estimator in comparison with the adapted existing methods.},

Below rated wind speed, the main control objective is to perform an optimal wind power capture while avoiding strong loads on the drive train shafts. To explicitly take into consideration the low speed shaft flexibility, a two-mass nonlinear model of the wind turbine is used for controllers synthesis. After adapting a LQG controller based on the linearized model, nonlinear controllers based on a wind speed estimator are developed. They take into account the nonlinear dynamic aspect of the wind turbine and the turbulent nature of the wind. The controllers are validated upon an aeroelastic wind turbine simulator for a realistic wind speed profile.

	abstract = {Reliable and powerful control strategies are needed for wind energy conversion systems to achieve maximum performance. A new control strategy for a variable speed, variable pitch wind turbine is proposed in this paper for the above-rated power operating condition. This multivariable control strategy is realized by combining a nonlinear dynamic state feedback torque control strategy with a linear control strategy for blade pitch angle. A comparison with existing strategies, PID and LQG controllers, is performed. The proposed approach results in better power regulation. The new control strategy has been validated using an aeroelastic wind turbine simulator developed by NREL for a high turbulence wind condition.},

	abstract = {To maximize wind power extraction, a variable-speed wind turbine (VSWT) should operate as close as possible to its optimal power coefficient. The generator torque is used as a control input to improve wind energy capture by forcing the wind turbine (WT) to stay close to the maximum energy point. In general, current control techniques do not take into account the dynamical and stochastic aspect of both turbine and wind, leading to significant power losses. In addition, they are not robust with respect to disturbances. In order to address these weaknesses, a nonlinear approach, without wind speed measurement for VSWT control, is proposed. Nonlinear static and dynamic state feedback controllers with wind speed estimator are then derived. The controllers were tested with a WT simple mathematical model and are validated with an aeroelastic wind turbine simulator in the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. The results have shown better performance in comparison with existing controllers.},

The control objective below rated wind speed is to maximize the extracted energy from the wind while reducing mechanical loads.

	abstract = {A nonlinear controller has been designed for variable speed wind turbines electric power regulation. The efficiency and reliability of wind power is shown to be depending on the applied control strategy of the wind turbine. Up to now, classical regulation is implemented only. However, under sudden wind profile variations, the wind turbine performance decrease which may cause troubles in the electrical network. For the limitation of mechanical loads and rotational speed variations, and to avoid the wind turbine stall above rated wind speeds while controlling the output power, a cascade structure asymptotic output tracking based approach has been applied. Simulations and validation have been performed using the wind turbine modelling and using wind turbine simulator as well. The wind turbine is torque generator controlled. The required performance is met for both},
