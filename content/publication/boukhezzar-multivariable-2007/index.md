abstract: Reliable and powerful control strategies are needed for wind energy conversion
  systems to achieve maximum performance. A new control strategy for a variable speed,
  variable pitch wind turbine is proposed in this paper for the above-rated power
  operating condition. This multivariable control strategy is realized by combining
  a nonlinear dynamic state feedback torque control strategy with a linear control
  strategy for blade pitch angle. A comparison with existing strategies, PID and LQG
  controllers, is performed. The proposed approach results in better power regulation.
  The new control strategy has been validated using an aeroelastic wind turbine simulator
  developed by NREL for a high turbulence wind condition.
