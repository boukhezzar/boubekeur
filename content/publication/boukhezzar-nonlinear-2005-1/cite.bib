 abstract = {A nonlinear controller has been designed for variable speed wind turbines electric power regulation. The efficiency and reliability of wind power is shown to be depending on the applied control strategy of the wind turbine. Up to now, classical regulation is implemented only. However, under sudden wind profile variations, the wind turbine performance decrease which may cause troubles in the electrical network. For the limitation of mechanical loads and rotational speed variations, and to avoid the wind turbine stall above rated wind speeds while controlling the output power, a cascade structure asymptotic output tracking based approach has been applied. Simulations and validation have been performed using the wind turbine modelling and using wind turbine simulator as well. The wind turbine is torque generator controlled. The required performance is met for both},
