abstract: A nonlinear controller has been designed for variable speed wind turbines
  electric power regulation. The efficiency and reliability of wind power is shown
  to be depending on the applied control strategy of the wind turbine. Up to now,
  classical regulation is implemented only. However, under sudden wind profile variations,
  the wind turbine performance decrease which may cause troubles in the electrical
  network. For the limitation of mechanical loads and rotational speed variations,
  and to avoid the wind turbine stall above rated wind speeds while controlling the
  output power, a cascade structure asymptotic output tracking based approach has
  been applied. Simulations and validation have been performed using the wind turbine
  modelling and using wind turbine simulator as well. The wind turbine is torque generator
  controlled. The required performance is met for both
