abstract: In this paper, a remote temperature control system has been proposed. The physical system is controlled in real time through the Internet network. For educational purpose, the students use only a web browser to tune and test a PID controller via shared user interface. The PID parameters are calculated using the basic experimental Ziegler-Nichols tuning rules. After hardware and software experiment description, the remote online experiment is tested and the results are given.
