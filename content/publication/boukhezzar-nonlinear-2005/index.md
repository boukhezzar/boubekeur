abstract: A nonlinear approach, for variable speed wind turbines control, is presented
  by considering that there is no wind speed measurement. The control objective below
  rated wind speed is to maximize the extracted energy from the wind while reducing
  mechanical loads. The existing control techniques do not take into account the dynamical
  aspect of the wind and the turbine, which leads to significant power losses, besides,
  they are not robust. In order to bring some improvement and to evaluate the applicability
  efficiency of the nonlinear controllers, so then, nonlinear static and dynamic state
  feedback controllers with wind speed estimator are derived. The controllers are
  tested upon a mathematical model and are validated with a wind turbine simulator,
  in presence of disturbances and measurement noise. The results indeed show significant
  improvements in comparison with the existing controllers.
